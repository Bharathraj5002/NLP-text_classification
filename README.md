#NLP Model for Text Analytics and Classification
This repository contains the implementation of an NLP-based text classification model designed to categorize complaints based on various parameters such as the victim, type of fraud, and other relevant details. The model preprocesses textual data, extracts important features, and classifies complaints into predefined categories.

#Objective
The goal of this project is to build a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can:

Preprocess and clean text data from complaint records.
Classify complaints based on the victim, type of fraud, and other relevant attributes.
Evaluate the performance of the model using standard classification metrics.
#Features
**Text Preprocessing:**

Tokenization
Stop word removal
Stemming/Lemmatization
Text cleaning (removal of noise like special characters, numbers, etc.)
Model Development:

Selection and training of an appropriate text classification model using machine learning algorithms.
Option to experiment with different models like Naive Bayes, SVM, or deep learning approaches.
Model Evaluation:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
Confusion Matrix
Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
numpy: for numerical computations
nltk: for natural language processing (e.g., tokenization, stemming, etc.)
scikit-learn: for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
